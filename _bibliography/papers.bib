    title = {Black hole superpotential as a unifying entropy function and BPS thermodynamics},
    author={Ntokos, Praxitelis and Papadimitriou, Ioannis},
    abstract={We develop an effective superpotential formalism for the SU(2)×U(1) invariant sector of $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauged supergravity in five dimensions with a U(1)$^3$ Fayet-Iliopoulos gauging, and determine the exact superpotential that describes all 1/4 BPS solutions in this sector. This includes the Gutowski-Reall black holes, but also a much broader class of solutions with a squashed $S^3$, magnetic flux and vector multiplet sources, as well as complex Euclidean BPS saddles. Some of these solutions are known only numerically, but the exact superpotential allows us to analytically evaluate the on-shell action, holographic one-point functions and conserved charges of all BPS solutions and to study their thermodynamics. In particular, by examining the supersymmetry Ward identities we show that solutions with supersymmetric vector multiplet sources break supersymmetry spontaneously. We also demonstrate the first law for black holes in the SU(2)×U(1) invariant sector and show that the conserved charges of supersymmetric solutions satisfy the generalized BPS relation derived in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04299'>arXiv:1703.04299</a>, which includes the supersymmetric Casimir energy as a consequence of the anomalous supersymmetry transformation of the $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supercurrent at the boundary. Finally, we show that the effective superpotential provides a unifying entropy extremization principle, reproducing Sen’s entropy function for near extremal black holes and the Hosseini-Hristov-Zaffaroni functional for complex Euclidean BPS saddles.},

    title = "Anomalies and supersymmetry",
    abstract={We revisit quantum field theory anomalies, emphasizing the interplay with diffeomorphisms and supersymmetry. The Ward identities of the latter induce Noether currents of all continuous symmetries, and we point out how these consistent currents are replaced by their covariant form through the appearance of the Bardeen-Zumino currents, which play a central role in our study. For supersymmetry Ward identities, two systematic methods for solving the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions are discussed: anomaly inflow and anomaly descent. The simplest inflows are from supersymmetric Chern-Simons actions in one dimension higher, which are used to supersymmetrize flavor anomalies in \(d=4\) and, for \(d=2\) \(\mathcal{N} = (p,q)\), flavor anomalies with \(p,q≤3\) and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies with \(p,q≤6\). Finally, we extend the BRST algebra and the subsequent descent, a necessity for the diffeomorphism anomaly in retrospect. The same modification computes the supersymmetrized anomalies, and determines the above Chern-Simons actions when these exist. },

    title = "AdS\(_{3}\) gravity and the complex SYK models",
    abstract={We provide a non conformal generalization of the Compère-Song-Strominger (CSS) boundary conditions for AdS3 gravity that breaks the \(\hat{u}(1)\) Kac-Moody-Virasoro symmetry to two \(u(1)\)s. The holographic dual specified by the new boundary conditions can be understood as an irrelevant deformation of a warped conformal field theory (WCFT). Upon consistent reduction to two dimensions, AdS\(_3\) gravity results in a deformed Jackiw-Teitelboim dilaton gravity model coupled to a Maxwell field. We show that near extremality the boundary conditions inherited from generalized CSS boundary conditions in three dimensions give rise to an effective action exhibiting the same symmetry breaking pattern as the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Besides the Schwarzian term reflecting the breaking of conformal symmetry, the effective action contains an additional term that captures the breaking of the \(\hat{u}(1)\) Kac-Moody symmetry. },

    title = "Supersymmetry anomaly in the superconformal Wess-Zumino model",
    abstract={We present a comprehensive analysis of supersymmetry anomalies in the free and massless Wess-Zumino (WZ) model in perturbation theory. At the classical level the model possesses \(\mathcal{N} = 1\) superconformal symmetry, which is partially broken by quantum anomalies. The form of the anomalies and the part of the symmetry they break depend on the multiplet of conserved currents used. It was previously shown that the R-symmetry anomaly of the conformal current multiplet induces an anomaly in Q-supersymmetry, which appears first in 4-point functions. Here we confirm this result by an explicit 1-loop computation using a supersymmetric Pauli-Villars regulator.
The conformal current multiplet does not exist in the regulated theory because the regulator breaks conformal invariance, R-symmetry and S-supersymmetry explicitly. The minimal massive multiplet is the Ferrara-Zumino (FZ) one and the supersymmetry preserved by the regulator is a specific field dependent combination of Q- and S- supersymmetry of the conformal multiplet. While this supersymmetry is non anomalous, conformal invariance, R-symmetry and the original Q- and S-supersymmetries are explicitly broken by finite contact terms, both in the regulated and renormalized theories.
A conformal current multiplet does exist for the renormalized theory and may be obtained from the FZ multiplet by a set of finite local counterterms that eliminate the explicit symmetry breaking, thus restoring superconformal invariance up to anomalies. However, this necessarily renders both Q- and S-supersymmetries anomalous, as is manifest starting at 4-point functions of conformal multiplet currents. The paper contains a detailed discussion of a number of issues and subtleties related to Ward identities that may be useful in a wider context. },

    title = "Counterterms, Kounterterms, and the variational problem in AdS gravity",
    abstract={We show that the Kounterterms for pure AdS gravity in arbitrary even dimensions coincide with the boundary counterterms obtained through holographic renormalization if and only if the boundary Weyl tensor vanishes. In particular, the Kounterterms lead to a well posed variational problem for generic asymptotically locally AdS manifolds only in four dimensions. We determine the exact form of the counterterms for conformally flat boundaries and demonstrate that, in even dimensions, the Kounterterms take exactly the same form. This agreement can be understood as a consequence of Anderson's theorem for the renormalized volume of conformally compact Einstein 4-manifolds and its higher dimensional generalizations by Albin and Chang, Qing and Yang. For odd dimensional asymptotically locally AdS manifolds with a conformally flat boundary, the Kounterterms coincide with the boundary counterterms except for the logarithmic divergence associated with the holographic conformal anomaly, and finite local terms. },

    title = "Supersymmetry anomalies in new minimal supergravity",
    abstract={We determine the general structure of quantum anomalies for the R-multiplet of four dimensional \(\mathcal{N} = 1\) supersymmetric quantum field theories in the presence of background fields for an arbitrary number of Abelian flavor multiplets. By solving the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions for off-shell new minimal supergravity in four dimensions with an arbitrary number of Abelian vector multiplets, we compute the anomaly in the conservation of the supercurrent to leading non trivial order in the gravitino and vector multiplet fermions. We find that both R-symmetry and flavor anomalies necessarily lead to a supersymmetry anomaly, thus generalizing our earlier results to non superconformal theories with Abelian flavor symmetries. The anomaly in the conservation of the supercurrent leads to an anomalous transformation for the supercurrent under rigid supersymmetry on bosonic backgrounds that admit new minimal Killing spinors. The resulting deformation of the supersymmetry algebra has implications for supersymmetric localization computations on such backgrounds. },

    title = "Anomalous Supersymmetry",
    abstract={We show that supersymmetry is anomalous in \(\mathcal{N} = 1\) superconformal quantum field theories (SCFTs) with an anomalous R-symmetry. This anomaly was originally found in holographic SCFTs at strong coupling. Here we show that this anomaly is present in general and demonstrate it for the massless superconformal Wess-Zumino model via a one loop computation. The anomaly appears first in four-point functions of two supercurrents with either two R-currents or with an R-current and an energy momentum tensor. In fact, the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions together with the standard R-symmetry anomaly imply the existence of the anomaly. We outline the implications of this anomaly.  },

    abstract={We solve the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions of \(\mathcal{N} = 1\) off-shell conformal supergravity in four dimensions and determine the general form of the superconformal anomalies for arbitrary a and c anomaly coefficients to leading non trivial order in the gravitino. Besides the well known Weyl and R-symmetry anomalies, we compute explicitly the fermionic Q- and S-supersymmetry anomalies. In particular, we show that Q-supersymmetry is anomalous if and only if R-symmetry is anomalous. The Q- and S-supersymmetry anomalies give rise to an anomalous supersymmetry transformation for the supercurrent on curved backgrounds admitting Killing spinors, resulting in a deformed rigid supersymmetry algebra. Our results may have implications for supersymmetric localization and supersymmetry phenomenology. Analogous results are expected to hold in dimensions two and six and for other supergravity theories.

    abstract={We study rotating black holes in five dimensions using the nAdS\(_2\)/nCFT\(_1\) correspondence. A consistent truncation of pure Einstein gravity (with a cosmological constant) in five dimensions to two dimensions gives a generalization of the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory that has two scalar fields: a dilaton and a squashing parameter that breaks spherical symmetry. The interplay between these two scalar fields is non trivial and leads to interesting new features. We study the holographic description of this theory and apply the results to the thermodynamics of the rotating black hole from a two dimensional point of view. This setup challenges notions of universality that have been advanced based on simpler models: we find that the mass gap of Kerr-AdS\(_5\) corresponds to an undetermined effective coupling in the nAdS\(_2\)/nCFT\(_1\) theory which depends on ultraviolet data.},

    title = "Thermoelectric DC conductivities in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories",
    abstract={We analytically compute the thermoelectric conductivities at zero frequency (DC) in the holographic dual of a four dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Axion-Dilaton theory that admits a class of asymptotically hyperscaling violating Lifshitz backgrounds with a dynamical exponent z and hyperscaling violating parameter \(θ\). We show that the heat current in the dual Lifshitz theory involves the energy flux, which is an irrelevant operator for \(z>1\). The linearized fluctuations relevant for computing the thermoelectric conductivities turn on a source for this irrelevant operator, leading to several novel and non-trivial aspects in the holographic renormalization procedure and the identification of the physical observables in the dual theory. Moreover, imposing Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the spatial components of one of the two Maxwell fields present leads to different thermoelectric conductivities. Dirichlet boundary conditions reproduce the thermoelectric DC conductivities obtained from the near horizon analysis of Donos and Gauntlett, while Neumann boundary conditions result in a new set of DC conductivities. We make preliminary analytical estimates for the temperature behavior of the thermoelectric matrix in appropriate regions of parameter space. In particular, at large temperatures we find that the only case which could lead to a linear resistivity \(ρ∼T\) corresponds to \(z=4/3\). },

    title = "Supercurrent anomalies in 4d SCFTs",
    abstract={We use holographic renormalization of minimal \(\mathcal{N} = 2\) gauged supergravity in order to derive the general form of the quantum Ward identities for 3d \(\mathcal{N} = 2\) and 4d \(\mathcal{N} = 1\) superconformal theories on general curved backgrounds, including an arbitrary fermionic source for the supercurrent. The Ward identities for 4d \(\mathcal{N} = 1\) theories contain both bosonic and fermionic global anomalies, which we determine explicitly up to quadratic order in the supercurrent source. The Ward identities we derive apply to any superconformal theory, independently of whether it admits a holographic dual, except for the specific values of the \(a\) and \(c\) anomaly coefficients, which are equal due to our starting point of a two-derivative bulk supergravity theory. We show that the fermionic anomalies lead to an anomalous transformation of the supercurrent under rigid supersymmetry on backgrounds admitting Killing spinors, even if all superconformal anomalies are numerically zero on such backgrounds. The anomalous transformation of the supercurrent under rigid supersymmetry leads to an obstruction to the Q-exactness of the stress tensor in supersymmetric vacua, and may have implications for the applicability of localization techniques. We use this obstruction to the Q-exactness of the stress tensor, together with the Ward identities, in order to determine the general form of the stress tensor and R-current one-point functions in supersymmetric vacua, which allows us to obtain general expressions for the supersymmetric Casimir charges and partition function.},

We obtain a new family of exact asymptotically AdS\(_4\) black branes with scalar hair, carrying magnetic and axion charge, and we study the thermodynamics and dynamic stability of these, as well as of a number of previously known electric and dyonic solutions with axion charge and scalar hair. The scalar hair for all solutions satisfy mixed boundary conditions, which lead to modified holographic Ward identities, conserved charges and free energy, relative to those following from the more standard Dirichlet boundary conditions. We show that properly accounting for the scalar boundary conditions leads to well defined first law and other thermodynamic relations. Finally, we compute the holographic quantum effective potential for the dual scalar operator and show that dynamical stability of the hairy black branes is equivalent to positivity of the energy density. },

    title = "Two-point Functions in a Holographic Kondo Model",
    abstract={We develop the formalism of holographic renormalization to compute two-point functions in a holographic Kondo model. The model describes a \((0+1)\)-dimensional impurity spin of a gauged $SU(N)$ interacting with a \((1+1)\)-dimensional, large-\(N\), strongly-coupled Conformal Field Theory (CFT). We describe the impurity using Abrikosov pseudo-fermions, and define an \(SU(N)\)-invariant scalar operator \(\mathcal{O}\) built from a pseudo-fermion and a CFT fermion. At large \(N\) the Kondo interaction is of the form \(\mathcal{O}^{\dagger} \mathcal{O}\), which is marginally relevant, and generates a Renormalization Group (RG) flow at the impurity. A second-order mean-field phase transition occurs in which \(\mathcal{O}\) condenses below a critical temperature, leading to the Kondo effect, including screening of the impurity. Via holography, the phase transition is dual to holographic superconductivity in \((1+1)\)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. At all temperatures, spectral functions of \(\mathcal{O}\) exhibit a Fano resonance, characteristic of a continuum of states interacting with an isolated resonance. In contrast to Fano resonances observed for example in quantum dots, our continuum and resonance arise from a \((0+1)\)-dimensional UV fixed point and RG flow, respectively. In the low-temperature phase, the resonance comes from a pole in the Green's function of the form \(-i \langle {\cal O} \rangle^2\), which is characteristic of a Kondo resonance. },

We show that at all temperatures \(T\), impurity spectral functions exhibit a Fano resonance, which in the low-\(T\) phase is a large-\(N\) manifestation of the Kondo resonance. We thus provide an example in which the Kondo resonance survives strong correlations, and uncover a novel mechanism for generating Fano resonances, via RG flows between \((0 + 1)\)-dimensional fixed points. },

    title = "AdS\(_{2}\) holographic dictionary",
    abstract={We construct the holographic dictionary for both running and constant dilaton solutions of the 2D Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory obtained by a circle reduction from 3D gravity with negative cosmological constant. This specific model ensures that the dual theory has a well defined ultraviolet completion in terms of a 2D CFT, but our results apply qualitatively to a wider class of 2D dilaton gravity theories. For each type of solutions we perform holographic renormalization, compute the exact renormalized one-point functions in the presence of arbitrary sources, and derive the asymptotic symmetries and conserved charges. In both cases we find that the scalar operator dual to the dilaton plays a crucial role in the description of the dynamics. Its source gives rise to a matter conformal anomaly for the running dilaton solutions, while its expectation value is the only non trivial observable for constant dilaton solutions. The role of this operator has been largely overlooked in the literature. We further show that the only non trivial conserved charges for running dilaton solutions are the mass and the electric charge, while for constant dilaton solutions only the electric charge is non zero. However, by uplifting the solutions to three dimensions we show that constant dilaton solutions can support non trivial extended symmetry algebras, including the one found by Compère, Song and Strominger, in agreement with results by Castro and Song. Finally, we demonstrate that any solution of this specific dilaton gravity model can be uplifted to a family of asymptotically AdS\(_2\times S^2\) or conformally AdS\(_2\times S^2\) solutions of the STU model in four dimensions. The four dimensional solutions obtained by uplifting the running dilaton solutions coincide with the so called `subtracted geometries', while those obtained from the uplift of the constant dilaton ones are new. },

The dual four-dimensional gauge theory is not conformal and, at zero temperature, exhibits a renormalisation group flow between two different fixed points. We quantify the deviations from conformality both in terms of thermodynamic observables and in terms of the bulk viscosity of the theory. The ratio of bulk over shear viscosity violates Buchel's bound. We study relaxation of small-amplitude, homogeneous perturbations by computing the quasi-normal modes of the system at zero spatial momentum. In this approximation we identify two different relaxation channels. At high temperatures, the different pressures first become approximately equal to one another, and subsequently this average pressure evolves towards the equilibrium value dictated by the equation of state. At low temperatures, the average pressure first evolves towards the equilibrium pressure, and only later the different pressures become approximately equal to one another. },

    title = "Black hole thermodynamics from a variational principle: Asymptotically conical backgrounds",
    abstract={The variational problem of gravity theories is directly related to black hole thermodynamics. For asymptotically locally AdS backgrounds it is known that holographic renormalization results in a variational principle in terms of equivalence classes of boundary data under the local asymptotic symmetries of the theory, which automatically leads to finite conserved charges satisfying the first law of thermodynamics. We show that this connection holds well beyond asymptotically AdS black holes. In particular, we formulate the variational problem for \(\mathcal{N}=2\) STU supergravity in four dimensions with boundary conditions corresponding to those obeyed by the so called `subtracted geometries'. We show that such boundary conditions can be imposed covariantly in terms of a set of asymptotic second class constraints, and we derive the appropriate boundary terms that render the variational problem well posed in two different duality frames of the STU model. This allows us to define finite conserved charges associated with any asymptotic Killing vector and to demonstrate that these charges satisfy the Smarr formula and the first law of thermodynamics. Moreover, by uplifting the theory to five dimensions and then reducing on a 2-sphere, we provide a precise map between the thermodynamic observables of the subtracted geometries and those of the BTZ black hole. Surface terms play a crucial role in this identification. },

    title = "A Holographic Two-Impurity Kondo Model",
    abstract={We propose a model of a strongly-interacting two-impurity Kondo system based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as holography. In a Landau Fermi Liquid, the single-impurity Kondo effect is the screening of an impurity spin at low temperature \(T\). The two-impurity Kondo model then describes the competition between the Kondo interaction and the Heisenberg interaction between two impurity spins, also called the RKKY interaction. For spin-\(1/2\) impurities, that competition leads to a quantum phase transition from a Kondo-screened phase to a phase in which the two impurity spins screen one another. Our holographic model is based on a \((1+1)\)-dimensional CFT description of the two-impurity Kondo model, reliable for two impurities with negligible separation in space. We consider only impurity spins in a totally anti-symmetric representation of an \(SU(N)\) spin symmetry. We employ a large-\(N\) limit, in which both Kondo and RKKY couplings are double-trace, and both Kondo and inter-impurity screening appear as condensation of single-trace operators at the impurities' location. We perform the holographic renormalization of our model, which allows us to identify the Kondo and RKKY couplings as boundary conditions on fields in AdS. We numerically compute the phase diagram of our model in the plane of RKKY coupling versus \(T\), finding evidence for a quantum phase transition from a trivial phase, with neither Kondo nor inter-impurity screening, to a non-trivial phase, with both Kondo and anti-ferromagnetic inter-impurity screening. More generally we show, just using \(SU(N)\) representation theory, that ferromagnetic correlations must be absent at leading order in the large-$N$ limit. Our holographic model may be useful for studying many open problems involving strongly-interacting quantum impurities, including for example the Kondo lattice, relevant for describing the heavy fermion compounds. },

There exists a two-parameter family of such solutions. Within this family, we show that those (and only those) solutions related to antiD-branes at the tip of the conifold correspond to dual field theory vacua where a goldstino mode is present and supercurrent Ward identities hold. Our findings do not depend on the IR singularity of the dual backgrounds, nor on its resolution. As such, they constitute an independent, necessary check for the existence of supersymmetry breaking vacua in the conifold cascading gauge theory. Our analysis relies on a holographic derivation of the Ward identities which has a wider applicability, beyond the specific system and symmetries considered here. },

Holographic renormalization is carried out for any theory in this class and the computation of the renormalized AC conductivities at zero spatial momentum is reduced to solving a single decoupled first order Riccati equation. Moreover, we develop a first order fake supergravity formulalism for dyonic renormalization group flows in four dimensions, allowing us to construct analytically infinite families of such backgrounds by specifying a superpotential at will. These RG flows interpolate between AdS$_4$ in the UV and a hyperscaling violating Lifshitz geometry in the IR with exponents \(1<z<3\) and \(\theta=z+1\). For \(1<z<2\) the spectrum of fluctuations is gapped and discrete. Our hope and intention is that this analysis can serve as a manual for computing the holographic 1- and 2-point functions and the corresponding transport coefficients in any dyonic background, both in the context of AdS/CMT and AdS/QCD. },

The analysis is carried out for a very general bottom up model of gravity coupled to a massive vector field and a dilaton with arbitrary scalar couplings. The solution of the radial Hamilton-Jacobi equation is obtained recursively in the form of a graded expansion in eigenfunctions of two commuting operators, which are the appropriate generalization of the dilatation operator for non scale invariant and Lorentz violating boundary conditions. The Fefferman-Graham expansions, the sources and 1-point functions of the dual operators, the Ward identities, as well as the local counterterms required for holographic renormalization all follow from this asymptotic solution of the radial Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We also find a family of exact backgrounds with \(z>1\) and \(\theta>0\) corresponding to a marginal deformation shifting the vector hyperscaling violating parameter and we present an example where the conformal anomaly contains the only \(z=2\) conformal invariant in \(d=2\) with four spatial derivatives. },

    abstract={Any second order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation can be transformed into a first order non-linear Riccati equation. We argue that the Riccati form of the linearized fluctuation equations that determine the holographic 2-point functions simplifies considerably the numerical computation of such 2-point functions and of the corresponding transport coefficients by computing directly the response functions, eliminating the arbitrary source from the start. Moreover, it provides a neat criterion for the infrared regularity of the fluctuations. In particular, it is shown that the infrared regularity conditions for scalar and tensor fluctuations coincide, and hence they are either both regular or both singular. We demonstrate our numerical recipe based on the Riccati equations by computing the holographic 2-point functions for the stress tensor and a scalar operator in a number of asymptotically anti de Sitter backgrounds of bottom up scalar-gravity models. Analytical results are obtained for the 2-point function of the transverse traceless part of the stress tensor in two confining geometries, including a geometry that belongs to the class of IHQCD. We find that in this background the spin-2 spectrum is linear and, as expected, the position space 2-point function decays exponentially at large distances at a rate proportional to the confinement scale. },

    abstract={The gauge/string dualities have drawn attention to a class of variational problems on a boundary at infinity, which are not well defined unless a certain boundary term is added to the classical action. In the context of supergravity in asymptotically AdS spaces these problems are systematically addressed by the method of holographic renormalization. We argue that this class of a priori ill defined variational problems extends far beyond the realm of holographic dualities. As we show, exactly the same issues arise in gravity in non asymptotically AdS spaces, in point particles with certain unbounded from below potentials, and even fundamental strings in flat or AdS backgrounds. We show that the variational problem in all such cases can be made well defined by the following procedure, which is intrinsic to the system in question and does not rely on the existence of a holographically dual theory: (i) The first step is the construction of the space of the most general asymptotic solutions of the classical equations of motion that inherits a well defined symplectic form from that on phase space. The requirement of a well defined symplectic form is essential and often leads to a necessary repackaging of the degrees of freedom. (ii) Once the space of asymptotic solutions has been constructed in terms of the correct degrees of freedom, then there exists a boundary term that is obtained as a certain solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation which simultaneously makes the variational problem well defined and preserves the symplectic form. This procedure is identical to holographic renormalization in the case of asymptotically AdS gravity, but it is applicable to any Hamiltonian system. },

We present a unified view of the previous results in the literature and find new exact solutions and new asymptotic solutions. Then we study the Physics encoded in these backgrounds, giving among other things a resolution to an old puzzle related to the beta function and a sufficient criteria for screening. We also extend our results to the \(SO(N_c)\) case where we present a candidate for the Wilson loop in the spinorial representation. Various aspects of this line of research are critically analyzed. },

    abstract={We present a general and systematic treatment of multi-trace deformations in the AdS/CFT correspondence in the large N limit, pointing out and clarifying subtleties relating to the formulation of the boundary value problem on a conformal boundary. We then apply this method to study multi-trace deformations in the presence of a scalar VEV, which requires the coupling to gravity to be taken into account. We show that supergravity solutions subject to `mixed' boundary conditions are in one-to-one correspondence with critical points of the holographic effective action of the dual theory in the presence of a multi-trace deformation, and we find a number of new exact analytic solutions involving a minimally or conformally coupled scalar field satisfying `mixed' boundary conditions. These include the generalization to any dimension of the instanton solution recently found in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0611315'>hep-th/0611315</a>. Finally, we provide a systematic method for computing the holographic effective action in the presence of a multi-trace deformation in a derivative expansion away from the conformal vacuum using Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Requiring that this effective action exists and is bounded from below reproduces recent results on the stability of the AdS vacuum in the presence of `mixed' boundary conditions. },

    abstract={We show that a scalar field conformally coupled to AdS gravity in four dimensions with a quartic self-interaction can be embedded into M-theory. The holographic effective potential is exactly calculated, allowing us to study non-perturbatively the stability of AdS\(_4\) in the presence of the conformally coupled scalar. It is shown that there exists a one-parameter family of conformal scalar boundary conditions for which the boundary theory has an unstable vacuum. In this case, the bulk theory has instanton solutions that mediate the decay of the AdS\(_4\) space. These results match nicely with the vacuum structure and the existence of instantons in an effective three-dimensional boundary model. },

These solutions are continuously connected to the supersymmetric domain walls describing a uniform sector of the Coulomb branch of the \(M2\)-brane theory. We also provide a general argument that under certain conditions identifies the fake superpotential with the exact large-\(N\) quantum effective potential of the dual theory, describing a marginal multi-trace deformation. This identification strongly motivates further study of fake supergravity as a solution generating method and it allows us to interpret our non-supersymmetric solutions as a family of marginal triple-trace deformations of the Coulomb branch that completely break supersymmetry and to calculate the exact large-\(N\) anomalous dimensions of the operators involved. The holographic one- and two-point functions for these solutions are also computed. },

The method utilizes a recently developed Hamiltonian version of holographic renormalization and it is more efficient than previous methods. A significant simplification concerns the treatment of infinities: instead of performing a general analysis of counterterms, we develop a method where only the contribution of counterterms to any given correlator needs to be computed. For instance, the computation of renormalized 2-point functions requires only an analysis at the linearized level. We illustrate the method by discussing flat and AdS-sliced domain walls. In particular, we discuss correlation functions of the Janus solution, a recently discovered non-supersymmetric but stable AdS-sliced domain wall. },

As a consequence we obtain the complete expression for the Yukawa couplings of chiral fermions with the Higgs fields.

The model solves the equations of motion in the presence of the damping caused by the interaction with the laser beam, and predicts for the first time the dependence of the cooling rates for the two radial degrees of freedom in the trap as a function of the laser detuning, laser beam offset and saturation parameter. The conditions derived for both radial degrees of freedom to be cooled simultaneously agree with those found in earlier studies. The results indicate that under conditions where both motions are cooled simultaneously, the cooling rates are both significantly smaller than the maximum rate for either motion considered in isolation. Furthermore, the magnetron cooling rate is typically much lower than the cyclotron cooling rate, as has been found in experiments. The model indicates how the cooling rate for a single ion may be optimized.},

    abstract={We provide a pedagogical introduction to the method of holographic renormalization, in its Hamiltonian incarnation. We begin by reviewing the description of local observables, global symmetries, and ultraviolet divergences in local quantum field theories, in a language that does not require a weak coupling Lagrangian description. In particular, we review the formulation of the Renormalization Group as a Hamiltonian flow, which allows us to present the holographic dictionary in a precise and suggestive language. The method of holographic renormalization is then introduced by first computing the renormalized two-point function of a scalar operator in conformal field theory and comparing with the holographic computation. We then proceed with the general method, formulating the bulk theory in a radial Hamiltonian language and deriving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Two methods for solving recursively the Hamilton–Jacobi equation are then presented, based on covariant expansions in eigenfunctions of certain functional operators on the space of field theory couplings. These algorithms constitute the core of the method of holographic renormalization and allow us to obtain the holographic Ward identities and the asymptotic expansions of the bulk fields.},

We discuss how QFT correlation functions, Ward identities and anomalies are encoded in the bulk geometry. In the second part we develop a Hamiltonian approach to the method of holographic renormalization, with the radial coordinate playing the role of time. In this approach regularized correlation functions are related to canonical momenta and the near-boundary expansions of the standard approach are replaced by covariant expansions where the various terms are organized according to their dilatation weight. This leads to universal expressions for counterterms and one-point functions (in the presence of sources) that are valid in all dimensions. The new approach combines optimally elements from all previous methods and supersedes them in efficiency. },

We demonstrate that the Dirichlet boundary conditions allow for a reduction of the second order field equations to a first order problem. The approach is meant to highlight the key points underlying the general method we present in [1], which is a simpler version of what is known as ‘holographic renorinalization’ in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
