<b>Dates:</b> Every Wednesday & Friday 2022-03-16 ~ 06-03, 13:30-15:05 (UTC +8:00)<br>
<b>Venue:</b> Conference room 3, Jinchunyuan West Building, Tsinghua Univ.<br>

<b>Description:</b><br> 
After a brief introduction to differential geometry and global supersymmetry, we will study minimal and extended supergravities in diverse dimensions. The course will be oriented towards applications of supergravities as backgrounds for supersymmetric quantum field theories, as well as in the AdS/CFT correspondence.

<b>Prerequisites:</b><br>
General Relativity or basic differential geometry, basic background in supersymmetry.<br>
